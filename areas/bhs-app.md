# BHS App

The core Beard's Home Services business management app.

- **Stack:** Python / SQLite, hosted on Railway, source in GitHub org `beardsservices-png`.
- Automation/hosting is Railway — deliberately not n8n.
- **Estimates/invoices:** generated with ReportLab, matching an "Order Summary" style layout. Base script `bhs_estimate_generator.py`, numbering scheme `BHS-YYMM-##`, all line items non-taxable, footer notes owner-operator / no upfront payment.
- **SMS pipeline:** Railway IPv4 fix applied, Pydantic timestamp fields corrected. SMS Forwarder body template on phone still needs updating to `{"from":"{{from}}","contact":"{{contact}}","message":"{{message}}"}` — not yet live.
- **Location/timeline feature:** Google Maps Timeline data integrated with the SQLite DB via Haversine matching (~16 months of location data).
- Includes an invoice/time-tracking database and a task management board built into the app.
- History: built an "OPS CENTER" HTML dashboard as the operational front end.
