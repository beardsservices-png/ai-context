# BHS App

The core Beard's Home Services business management app.

## Which repo is canonical

**`beardsservices-png/BHSmobileapp` is the live app.** It's what Railway deploys and what runs on the phone. All work goes here.

`beardsservices-png/beard-business-app` is **deprecated** — the original desktop-only repo, dead since 2026-04-05. Do not commit to it.

- Same git history: `BHSmobileapp` was seeded by pushing the existing local folder to a new remote on 2026-05-03, so both share every commit from `4381393` (initial, 2026-02-28) through `374a745` (2026-04-05).
- The split was the move to Railway/mobile — first divergent commit is the Railway deployment config.
- `beard-business-app` is a strict subset: zero files exist there that aren't in `BHSmobileapp`. Nothing to migrate.
- Everything after the split — Railway deploy, GPS time clock, the in-app payment/invoice module, SMS leads inbox, Retell/Bill webhook, Settings page, PDF invoice import — exists only in `BHSmobileapp`.
- The `CLAUDE.md` in `beard-business-app` is stale (February version, describes a smaller app). The one in `BHSmobileapp` is current.

## Stack

- Python / SQLite, hosted on Railway, source in GitHub org `beardsservices-png`.
- Automation/hosting is Railway — deliberately not n8n.
- **Estimates/invoices:** generated with ReportLab, matching an "Order Summary" style layout. Base script `bhs_estimate_generator.py`, numbering scheme `BHS-YYMM-##`, all line items non-taxable, footer notes owner-operator / no upfront payment.
- **SMS pipeline:** Railway IPv4 fix applied, Pydantic timestamp fields corrected. SMS Forwarder body template on phone still needs updating to `{"from":"{{from}}","contact":"{{contact}}","message":"{{message}}"}` — not yet live.
- **Location/timeline feature:** Google Maps Timeline data integrated with the SQLite DB via Haversine matching (~16 months of location data).
- Includes an invoice/time-tracking database and a task management board built into the app.
- History: built an "OPS CENTER" HTML dashboard as the operational front end.
